# Awesome Open Source Cursor Alternatives

An evolving list of open-source alternatives to Cursor, the AI-first code editor. This list aims to help developers find powerful, flexible, and privacy-conscious AI-assisted coding tools that they can often self-host, customize, or contribute to.

Cursor has set a high bar for AI integration in the development workflow. However, the open-source community is rapidly innovating, offering a diverse range of tools that provide similar (and sometimes unique) functionalities. Whether you're looking for IDE extensions, standalone editors, or specific AI models, this list is a starting point for your exploration.

## Why Open Source Alternatives?

*   **Customization & Control:** Modify and tailor the tools to your exact needs.
*   **Self-Hosting & Privacy:** Keep your code and data within your own infrastructure.
*   **Transparency:** Understand how the AI models and tools work under the hood.
*   **Community Support:** Benefit from and contribute to a vibrant ecosystem.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Often free to use, with options for self-hosting to manage costs.
*   **Flexibility with LLMs:** Many open-source tools allow you to connect to a variety of local or remote Large Language Models.

## Full IDEs / Editors with Deep AI Integration

*(This section is for IDEs that are built from the ground up with AI capabilities or are significant forks of existing IDEs like VS Code, with deep AI integration. Research needed to populate this section.)*

## IDE Extensions

### Continue.dev

*   **Description:** `continue` aims to be an open-source autopilot for software development. It provides an IDE extension (for VS Code and JetBrains IDEs) that allows you to connect various LLMs (local, API-based like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and use them for chat, code generation, editing, and more, directly within your editor. It emphasizes customizability through "slash commands" and context providers.
*   **Key Features (based on GitHub README):**
    *   **IDE Integration:** Works with VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.
    *   **Model Flexibility:** Connect to local models (Ollama, Llamafile, etc.), OpenAI, Anthropic, Together, and other model providers.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Ability to reference current files, terminal output, git history, and more for better AI responses.
    *   **Customizable Prompts & Commands:** Define your own reusable prompts and "slash commands" for common tasks.
    *   **Code Generation & Editing:** Generate new code, refactor existing code, explain code, and debug.
    *   **Natural Language Editing:** Edit code by describing changes in natural language.
    *   **Terminal Access:** Ask questions about terminal output.
*   **License:** Apache-2.0
*   **Link:** [GitHub - continuedev/continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue)
*   **Pros:**
    *   Highly extensible and customizable.
    *   Supports a wide range of local and remote LLMs.
    *   Strong focus on context gathering for better AI assistance.
    *   Active development and community.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Being highly customizable means it might require some setup and configuration to get the most out of it.
    *   The range of features and options can be overwhelming for new users.

## Self-Hosted AI Code Completion & Assistants

*(This section is for tools that primarily focus on providing code completion and AI assistance that can be fully self-hosted. Research needed to populate this section with tools like FauxPilot, TabbyML etc.)*

*   **TabbyML (Requires further research for this list):**
    *   **Description:** Often cited as an open-source, self-hosted alternative to GitHub Copilot.
    *   **Key Features:** Self-hosted code completion, supports various models.
    *   **License:** (Verify on project page)
    *   **Link:** (Find official GitHub/website)

*   **FauxPilot (Requires further research for this list):**
    *   **Description:** A project aimed at providing an open-source, local alternative to GitHub Copilot, often leveraging models like CodeGen.
    *   **Key Features:** Self-hosted, local AI code completion.
    *   **License:** (Verify on project page)
